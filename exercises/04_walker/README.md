# Walker
The `walker.ts` file contains a small application that constructs a walker.

## Prerequisites

Install the node dependencies by running `npm install` in the exercise folder.

## Goal
The app is not fully operational yet. Complete the TODOs and resolve the errors in order to have the walker constructed in a type-safe way.
