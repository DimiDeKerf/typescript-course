# Hello There

Create a `HelloThere` class that has a static `hello` function. When calling this function with a name parameter, the function should log "Hello [the given name]!" in the console. If you pass no parameter, "Hello there!" should be logged.

## Prerequisites

Install the node dependencies by running `npm install` in the exercise folder.

## Goal
Make sure all the tests pass in `hello-there.spec.ts`. Run the test by executing following command in the exercise folder:
```
npm test
```
